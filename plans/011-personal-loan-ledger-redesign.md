## Phase 2 (scope expanded) — resolved migration contract (DECISION 1 + DECISION 2)

DECISION 1 (Option 1 wins): `tracked=false` is the universal default for ALL
pre-existing rows across `loans`, `bank_loans`, and `installments` (single
additive `MIGRATION_8_9`). Historical transactions created before this
migration are NEVER touched, deleted, or reversed. Going forward, any
repayment on a pre-existing (backfilled) row does NOT create an account
transaction unless the user explicitly enables tracked for that record.
Accepted, intentional behavior change: mid-lifecycle inconsistency (early
repayments have transactions, later ones do not unless opted in) is the
correct outcome of the opt-in philosophy, not a bug.

DECISION 2 (scope expansion): the tracked/accountId three-state model applies
identically to Loan, BankLoan, and Installment. Bank-loan installments keep
ledger-only defaults; each installment's own tracked flag governs its paid
toggles. The parent bank loan's tracked flag governs only the one-time
disbursement leg. Installment creation posts an initial expense only when the
row is created already-paid with tracked=true and recordInitial=true.

## Status

- Priority: P1
- Effort: XL
- Risk: HIGH — Room migration, backup schema round-trip, FFI signature changes, and financial KPI semantics all change.
- Depends on: none hard. Phase 2 and Phase 3 both need Phase 1; they are independent of each other.
- Category: feature + bug
- Planned at: commit `f425bd0`, branch `feature/person-loan-ledger`

## Overview

Redesign the personal loan section ("قرض و طلب شخصی") around a person ledger:

1. A `Person` entity replaces free-text person names as the source of identity.
2. Each loan record is either ledger-only (no account impact) or tracked and
   linked to a chosen account.
3. Transaction forms get a shared person picker with inline create.
4. Known loan bugs stay fixed (Phase 0 is already done on this branch).

## Resolved design decisions

### D1 — Initial-leg transaction vs pre-existing manual entry

`Transaction` has no link column for loans (only `installmentId`,
`Entities.kt`). Attach-to-existing matching would be fuzzy and fragile. The
loan form therefore offers an explicit tri-state when tracked mode is on:

| User choice | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Post initial leg now (default ON for new loans) | Create the initial INCOME/EXPENSE transaction |
| Already recorded manually | No initial leg; only future repayments post |
| Tracked off | Ledger-only record, never touches accounts |

Double counting is prevented by explicit user choice plus helper text under
the checkbox. No extra schema column is needed; the choice happens at create
time only.

### D2 — Loans & Debt category exclusion from KPI aggregates

Raw ledgers keep every transaction. Only aggregate KPIs exclude the category
resolved by key `"Loans"` (ids differ per install, so Kotlin resolves ids and
passes them down). Full consumer inventory:

Rust core (all currently sum without category filter):
- `dashboard.rs` compute_dashboard monthly income/expenses + savings rate,
  and per-account summaries with month-over-month deltas.
- `analytics.rs` monthly trend series (all-accounts and per-account paths).
- `advisory/budget.rs` offline budget advice totals + saving rate, forecast
  income/expense estimates, and `monthly_income_baseline` which feeds
  `calculate_debt_to_income_ratio` and `calculate_financial_health_score`.

Kotlin mirrors that must stay consistent:
- `GetDashboardDataUseCase.computeFallbackDashboardData` +
  `computeAccountSummaries`
- `GetAnalyticsUseCase` fallback path
- `BudgetAdvisor.kt` local totals, local debt-to-income, local health score
- `BudgetAdviceGenerator.kt` advice-prompt summary
- `BudgetForecastPrompt.kt` forecast-prompt facts (`ForecastFacts.of`, fed by
  the exclusion resolved in `BudgetAdvisor.getBudgetForecast`; decision
  2026-09-19: both AI prompts report filtered KPI totals, so advice and
  forecast never disagree about "real" income or expense)

Kept untouched on purpose: `ExcelExporter` sheets and the transaction list —
they are cash-movement ledgers, not KPIs.

Implementation shape: add `excludedCategoryIds: List<i64>` parameters to the
affected FFI functions, one shared helper in Rust applied by all three
modules, mirrored by the Kotlin fallbacks. Signature changes require updating
`app/buildSrc/template/HesabyarCore.template.kt`, then running
`:app:generateAndFixBindings --rerun-tasks`.

Unresolved-category behavior (decided): `"Loans"` is a seeded default
(`Category.DEFAULTS`, `Entities.kt`) and the delete affordance is hidden for
default categories (`CategoryManagementScreen.kt`). `HesabyarRepository.deleteCategory`
now re-reads `isDefault` from the persisted row (so a forged
`Category(id=…, isDefault=false)` cannot delete a default row), and tests
cover both the honest and forged paths
(`RepositoryLogicTest.deleteCategoryKeepsDefaultCategoriesAndDeletesCustomOnes`
+ `RepositoryLogicTest.deleteCategoryRejectsWhenCallerLiesAboutIsDefault`).
Restore paths can still alter default-category rows, so resolution is allowed
to fail: an empty `excludedCategoryIds` list means no KPI filtering
(aggregates keep their current semantics) plus one `AppLogger.w` warning per
resolution attempt site. Phase 2 must include an explicit test for the
empty-list case (Rust helper + each Kotlin mirror).

#### Missing-"Loans"-category creation behavior (finalized)

For entity creation paths with an initial transaction leg (`Loan` and `BankLoan`):
- When `tracked = true` and `recordInitial = true`, the creation logic requires resolving
  the default `"Loans"` category. If the category cannot be resolved from the database,
  the operation throws `IllegalStateException` with a per-context message —
  `"Loans category is missing; cannot record the initial loan transaction"`
  (LoanDelegate) and `"Loans category is missing; cannot record the bank loan
  disbursement transaction"` (BankLoanDelegate) —
  within `withTransaction { }`. This guarantees full atomic rollback with zero rows written
  (zero loans/bank loans, zero installments, zero transactions).
- When `tracked = false` or `recordInitial = false`, no initial transaction is posted.
  Creation always succeeds regardless of whether the `"Loans"` category is present in the database.
  This applies identically to `LoanDelegate.insertLoanWithInitial` and `BankLoanDelegate.insertBankLoanWithInitial`.
  Installment creation (`InstallmentDelegate.insertInstallmentWithInitial`) mirrors this behavior
  identically with the default `"Installments"` category.

### D3 — `loans.personName` is sync-on-rename

`renamePerson(personId, newName)` runs in one `withTransaction`: update
`Person.name`, then update `loans.personName` and `transactions.personName`
where `personId = ?`. This needs the additive `personId` column on
`transactions` too (Phase 1). Display rule: UI always reads the denormalized
`personName` cache on Loan/Transaction rows; never joins `Person` for display.
Legacy rows with `personId = NULL` stay stale after renames — documented
limitation.

### D4 — Person-name normalization before dedup (backfill and runtime)

Dedup key = normalize(name): trim; collapse internal whitespace; remove
zero-width characters; fold Arabic variants to Persian (`ي→ی`, `ك→ک`, `ة→ه`);
lowercase the Latin part. Store the first trimmed original as the display
name. Identity enforcement uses a persisted `persons.normalizedName` column
with a unique index — not the raw display name — populated during migration
backfill and maintained atomically by every create/rename/merge path, so two
raw spellings that normalize alike can never produce separate person rows.
The same util lives in `domain/utils` (Room migrations cannot call Rust;
this is data hygiene/mapping, covered by the explicit "Person-name
normalization" row in ADR-001's Permanent Kotlin Fallbacks table) and is
reused whenever a person is created at runtime, so duplicates cannot reappear
later.

### D4 addendum (resolved during Phase 1) — Backfill source ordering & transactions-side fallback

**Decision:** backfill runs in two ordered phases — **loans first, transactions
after** (call order in `MIGRATION_7_8.migrate`: `backfillPersonsFromLoans` then
`stampPersonIdsOnTransactions`). This ordering is **intentional and permanent**,
not a side effect of function call order. Rationale:

- Loans are the primary identity source for persons (a Loan is always attributed
  to a person, a Transaction may not be). Running loans first guarantees a loan's
  `displayForm(personName)` becomes the canonical `Person.name` for any shared
  normalized key.
- A transaction whose `personName` has **no matching loan** keeps `personId NULL`:
  `stampPersonIdsOnTransactions` is **lookup-only** — it resolves `personId` only
  when the normalized key already exists in `idByNormalized` (populated from
  loans) and never calls the insert-capable `personIdFor`. Loans are the identity
  source, so transaction-only names must not spawn phantom `persons` rows that
  surface in the person ledger. This is the behavior the migration's own contract
  documents and the PR review required (thread db-id 3871531314).

**Display-name tiebreak policy:** when a loan and a transaction share a normalized
key but the transaction's variant is dated earlier, the **loan's** `displayForm`
wins as `Person.name` because loans populate the key (and the row) before the
transaction stamps it. This is asserted by
`migration7to8DisplayNameTiebreakLoansFirstThenTransactions`.

**Not adopted:** a single chronological pass across both `loans` and
`transactions` for name resolution. Rejected because loans and transactions have
no shared sequence space that meaningfully orders identity, and merging would
re-introduce ambiguity for rows that should stay loan-attributed. The two-phase
ordering is explicit and cheaper.

Tests covering both outcomes:
- `migration7to8BackfillsPersonsAndStampsBothLoansAndTransactions` (updated: tx3
  "نام بی‌وام" has no matching loan, so it keeps `personId NULL` and no person is
  seeded; persons count is 2, not 3).
- `migration7to8TransactionOnlyPersonNameStaysNull` (transaction-only name does
  NOT seed a person row; its `personId` stays NULL).
- `migration7to8DisplayNameTiebreakLoansFirstThenTransactions` (loan wins date tie).

### D5 — Backup compatibility (verified, not assumed)

The primary parse path is Rust serde (`BackupJsonParser.kt` prefers
`RustBridge.parseBackupJsonSync`; `lib.rs parse_backup_json`). Verified:
every existing list in `BackupPayload`
(`rust/hesabyar-core/src/models/mod.rs:418-434`) carries
`#[serde(default)]`, no struct uses `deny_unknown_fields`, and the
hand-written `Default impl` mirrors every field. Phase 1 already added the
`persons` field with `#[serde(default)]` and updated the `Default` impl; the
Kotlin fallback parser (`BackupJsonParser.parsePersons`,
`domain/usecase/PersonBackupValidator`) was kept in lockstep. Consequences:

- Old backup → new app: safe once `persons` has `#[serde(default)]` and new
  Loan fields have `#[serde(default, alias = ...)]`.
- New backup → old app: restore succeeds but person links and tracked flags
  are dropped silently. Accepted limitation; document in BACKUP_FORMAT.md.
- Critical: because Rust parsing is primary, every new Loan column must land
  in the Rust `Loan` struct AND `RustMappers` AND the Kotlin fallback parser
  in the same change, or even a same-version round trip loses data silently.
- Add both directions of round-trip tests (JSON without `persons`, JSON with
  `persons`) in Phase 1.

`BACKUP_SCHEMA_VERSION` stays unchanged: additions are backward-compatible.

## Phase 0 — Loan bug fixes — DONE on this branch

1. Edit dialog preserves repaid money: `paidSoFar = original − remaining`;
   `newRemaining = max(0, newOriginal − paid)`; recompute `isSettled`.
2. Overpayment is rejected with a message; repository returns false instead
   of clamping (`addPaymentToLoan`).
3. Delete confirmation dialog; payment history rows removed in the same
   `withTransaction` as the loan (`deletePaymentHistoryForLoan`).
4. Typo fix «جديد» → «جدید».

Evidence: `ktlintCheck detekt`, `compileDebugKotlin`, `testDebugUnitTest` all
BUILD SUCCESSFUL; 63 suites with zero failures; new tests
`addPaymentToLoanOverpaymentIsRejectedWithoutSideEffects` and
`deleteLoanRemovesItsPaymentHistoriesInSameTransaction` pass by name.
Detekt findings introduced here were resolved by extracting
`LoanRepaymentDialog` + `RepaymentFormState` (no suppressions, no baseline).

## Phase 1 — Person model (schema + CRUD) — DONE

See the authoritative addendum below for backfill ordering, display-name
tiebreak, and the option-(a) transaction-only fallback decision.
Implementation details live in the code; the test list is mirrored in
`AppDatabaseMigrationTest`, `PersonRepositoryTest`, and
`RepositoryBackupRestoreTest`. Schema and Rust surface match
`Entities.kt` and `rust/hesabyar-core/src/models/mod.rs`.

**D4 addendum (resolved during Phase 1).** See §D4 addendum above for the authoritative ordering and lookup-only contract.

The details there apply here without duplication.

For all other Phase 1 details (Person schema, MIGRATION_7_8,
`PersonDao`, `upsertPerson`/`renamePerson`/`mergePersons`, backup
`persons` field, test names, evidence bundle), consult the
git log of `feature/person-loan-ledger` for the commit(s) that
implemented Phase 1 — keeping a duplicated prose summary here
diverges from the code on every refactor.

## Phase 2 — Ledger-only vs tracked mode

1. Additive columns `loans.tracked: Boolean = false`,
   `loans.accountId: Long? = null`. Default false matches the primary user
   scenario (record exists, money movement predates the app or stays private).
2. Repayment honors the loan's flag: tracked → INCOME/EXPENSE on
   `accountId`; untracked → balance-only, no transaction.
3. Loan form gains the tracked checkbox + account picker (active accounts
   only) + D1 tri-state initial-leg control.
4. Dashboard debtor/creditor totals count both modes (they are real claims).
5. Implement D2 exclusion so repayment legs do not distort monthly income,
   expenses, savings rate, forecasts, DTI, and health score.
6. Tests: tracked/untracked repayment matrix, KPI exclusion parity between
   Rust and each Kotlin mirror, template/bindings regeneration check.

## Phase 3 — Persons ledger UI

1. `PersonsScreen`: one row per person with net position
   (my receivables − my debts), search. Direction is never color-only: pair
   the tint with an explicit direction icon and label, and expose the meaning
   through semantics (`contentDescription` or `semantics {}`) so screen
   readers and color-blind users get the same information.
2. Net computation is business logic: new Rust core function (for example
   `compute_person_balances`) per ADR-001, Kotlin fallback within allowed
   exceptions, bindings regenerated.
3. Person detail sheet/screen: combined timeline of loans + payment history,
   quick actions (new receivable/debt, settle fully).
4. DebtHub third tab becomes this view; dashboard DebtorCreditorCards links
   into it filtered by direction.
5. Reuse shared components only (`HesabyarCard`, `CurrencyFormatter`,
   `formatPersianDate`); no local copies.

## Phase 4 — Transaction form integration

1. Shared `PersonPicker` composable in `ui/components`: dropdown of existing
   persons + inline "+ new person" using the D4 normalizer.
2. Wire into `ManualTransactionFormSections` and Smart Assistant paths for
   `LOAN_DEBTOR` / `LOAN_CREDITOR`: person field, tracked checkbox, account
   picker, initial-leg control.
3. Extend `SubmitManualTransactionUseCase` to create Loan (+optional
   Transaction) atomically through one use case.
4. Connect the smart parser route («از رضا ۳ میلیون طلب دارم») to the same
   use case with person match-or-create.

## Phase 5 — Cleanup and verification

1. Move hardcoded strings of this section to `strings.xml`.
2. Audit M3 token usage in loan components (manual colors/alphas).
3. Full workflow: `ktlintFormat` → `ktlintCheck detekt` →
   `compileDebugKotlin` → `testDebugUnitTest` → `cargo test` +
   `testDebugUnitTestRust` (after Rust changes) → final `test --rerun-tasks`.

## Risks

- Migration backfill must run before any new write path relies on `personId`.
- FFI signature changes without template updates break
  `uniffiCheckApiChecksums` at load time; every Rust-tagged test fails first.
- Old-app restores of new backups lose person links (accepted, documented).

## STOP conditions

- Any destructive migration step (DROP/RECREATE of populated tables).
- Round-trip test losing loan fields through the Rust parser path.
- Detekt finding resolved by suppression or baseline instead of refactor.
